    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>A classic pizza recipe begins with a homemade or store-bought pizza dough, stretched or rolled out to your desired thickness on a floured surface. The dough is then placed on a pizza stone or baking sheet and topped with a rich tomato sauce, which can be seasoned with garlic, oregano, and a pinch of sugar. Next, a generous layer of shredded mozzarella cheese is spread over the sauce. The toppings are where you can get creative, adding ingredients like pepperoni, sliced bell peppers, mushrooms, onions, and black olives to suit your taste. A drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese provide the finishing touches. The pizza is baked in a preheated oven at around 475째F (245째C) for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned. Once out of the oven, it's best to let it cool for a minute or two before slicing, ensuring a perfect, cheesy, and delicious pizza ready to be enjoyed.</p>

        <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Dried Oregano</li>
        <li>Sugar (for seasoning the sauce)</li>
        <li>Shredded Mozzarella Cheese</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Preheat the Oven:</b> Preheat your oven to 475째F (245째C). Place a pizza stone or a baking sheet in the oven while it's preheating.</li>
        <li><b>Prepare the Dough:</b> Roll out or stretch the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness. You can make it thin and crispy or thicker for a chewy crust.</li>
        <li><b>Prepare the Sauce:</b> In a small bowl, mix the tomato sauce with minced garlic, dried oregano, and a pinch of sugar to taste. This seasoned tomato sauce will be the base for your pizza.</li>
        <li><b>Assemble the Pizza:</b> Place the rolled-out dough onto a piece of parchment paper or a pizza peel for easy transfer to the preheated stone or baking sheet. Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust. Next, sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.</li>
        <li><b>Add Toppings:</b> Add your desired toppings to the pizza. This is where you can get creative. Common choices include pepperoni, bell peppers, mushrooms, onions, and black olives.</li>
        <li><b>Drizzle with Olive Oil:</b> Lightly drizzle olive oil over the pizza, which not only adds flavor but helps with browning.</li>
        <li><b>Bake the Pizza:</b> Carefully transfer the pizza (with the parchment paper if using) onto the preheated stone or baking sheet in the oven. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
        <li><b>Cool and Slice:</b> Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a minute or two. This makes it easier to slice. Use a pizza cutter or a sharp knife to slice your delicious homemade pizza into wedges or squares.</li>
        <li><b>Serve and Enjoy:</b> Serve your pizza hot and enjoy your homemade culinary creation!</li>
