  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>French toast is a classic and comforting breakfast dish enjoyed by many. To make it, you'll need slices of bread, preferably a day or two old, which are soaked in a mixture of beaten eggs, milk, and a dash of vanilla extract for added flavor. After a brief dip in this custard-like mixture, the bread is pan-fried in butter until it's golden brown and crispy on the outside, while still soft and slightly custardy on the inside. This delightful treat can be customized to your taste, topped with a variety of options like maple syrup, powdered sugar, fresh fruits, or even a dollop of whipped cream. It's a simple yet satisfying morning indulgence that brings warmth and nostalgia to your breakfast table.</p>
