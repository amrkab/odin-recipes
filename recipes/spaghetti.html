    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Spaghetti is a classic Italian pasta dish that combines simplicity and flavor in a harmonious way. To prepare a delicious spaghetti recipe, start by boiling a pot of salted water and cooking the spaghetti until it's al dente. In a separate pan, heat some olive oil and sauté minced garlic until fragrant. Add crushed red pepper flakes for a hint of heat, followed by canned crushed tomatoes, and let it simmer to create a flavorful sauce. Season with salt, pepper, and fresh basil leaves. Once the spaghetti is cooked, drain it and combine it with the tomato sauce, allowing the pasta to soak up the flavors. Serve the spaghetti with a generous sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese and fresh basil leaves for a delightful and satisfying meal. This classic dish offers a perfect balance of simple, fresh ingredients and comforting taste.</p>
